# Alliance
## How should it work?
When there are multiple factions in the server there should be a way to create bigger factions.
Adding more ways to create alliances via inbuilt methods is a great way to make bigger factions possible.

A faction can be three allied with factions at the same time and an additional five players without factions.
It's important to allow alliances between factions and players.

Alliances should help in combat and "building" and wars.
Faction wars is something that needs to be thought and how it works.
Should creating an alliance cost?
